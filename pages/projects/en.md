Past projects completed during the Bachelor's.

### Replicates of previouslly published scientific works) ###

The projects below are just replicates of the published computational analysis carried out by other scientists. Thus, despite there might be minor differences, the bulk of the creation is *not* my own original work. Reference to the scientific article this work is based on may be found in the *references* section.

{% include table.html %}

* [Pipeline](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_1/html/) for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integral analysis.
 
* [Python report](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_2/synteny.pdf) and its [script](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_2/tarea_2.py) running the synteny algorithm on the genomes of *M. pneumoniae* and *M. genitalium*.
 
* [RNA-seq *de novo* pipeline](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_3/tarea_3.html) analysing data from *Xenopus tropicalis*.
 
* [Variant call analysis](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_4/tarea4.pdf) and its [shell script](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/BAG_4/GWAS.sh) (in Spanish).

### Original work ###

These projects are either extended analysis work of published data, or truly original work.

* [Bioinformatics and Genomic Analysis final exam](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/EXAM/examen.pdf) consisting of 2 parts:
 
   1. Extended ChIP-seq analysis for prediction of PIF1 and PIF4 interaction in *A. thaliana*
   2. RNA-seq *de novo* analysis of early and late embrionary states in *X. tropicalis* using edgeR.

* [Bachelor Thesis](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/TFG/tfg.pdf), entitled "Caracterización de la proteína All1873" (in Spanish).
