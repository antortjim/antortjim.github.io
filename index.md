Hi! My name is Antonio Ortega, and I am a first year student at the MSc. in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I finished my Bachelor of Science at the University of Seville, Spain. On this page I will bore you with the reasons why I decided to pursue a career in Bioinformatics.

First of all, I love learning random stuff, mainly online and on Youtube. I follow channels like Vsauce, Veritasium, Langfocus, Art of the Problem, iBiology.. I like learning good science because of its ability to keep simple and, at the same time, explaining what we see and we perceive in an easy to understand way. I am fond of speaking languages, and programming code. I decided to study Biochemistry because I would like to do some science-related bachelor and my parents are doctors, so there you have it!

During the programme, I was introduced to Bioinformatics, a discipline with a huge capacity to transform our lives and our societies. Residing at the crossroads of biology, mathematics and computer science, to me it seemed to be a rewarding topic, where I would learn a lot. Indeed, stats can go crazy from time to time. And so, I ended up studying in the very Nordic capital of Denmark, Copenhagen.

I try to invest my free time on productive stuff. One of the best ways to get to know oneself is travelling, and so I find it an extremely fulfilling activity. The rest of the time I practice jogging and strength training, and I enjoy social life in the University of Copenhagen.
