Hi! My name is Antonio Ortega. I am a bioinformatician by training with great interest in data science and learning all kinds of stuff, specially languages, currently focusing on Danish (I live in Denmark) and Japanese (such a challenging and mysterious one).

 I love watching documentaries on History, politics and society to help me understand the world around me. It might sound like BS, but I feel a responsability to leave the world better than I found it. I enjoy following tutorials on open-source technologies and DIY projects. They are so cool and "hacky"!

I am currently looking for a job in bioinformatics/data science. While I reside in Copenhagen, Denmark, I consider positions overseas, specially if it can lead to getting to know the culture, the language and in general a fruitful adventure.

In this website you will find more about me, my skills and a portfolio showcasing my experience. I see myself as a curious person who is committed to work very hard when there's a clear and meaningful goal at sight.
