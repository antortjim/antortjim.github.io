Hi! My name is Antonio Ortega. I am a bioinformatician studying and quantifying behavior at the Liu Lab in the VIB/KU Leuven Center for Brain and Disease Research in Leuven, Belgium. Here you will find information about the tools I use at my work, and my scientific interests.

I am originally from Huelva, Spain.
